# GraphTx
A simple utility for graphing word relationships in sentances.

## What it is
This application (when compiled) translates an ASCII text file into a DOT graph for reinterpritation.

## What it is not
- A rendering utility
- A statistical analyser
- A word processor
- A calculator
- A breadmaker
- Any thing other than what it is

## The Vision
The idea behind this applicatiion is mainly what it does (see out.dot and marrylamb.svg).  Additionaly I have in mind to make it group different kinds of words together such as nouns, verbs, articles, et cetera, number the connections in the order they occure, and collect statistics on word and letter usage.
