# Pallet Modeler
Generate pallets of arbitrary size using predefined materials and known dimmentions.

## About this project
This project is founded on a task I receved to make pallets for one of my employers.  As a programer and an engineer, I have documented my work by drafting/modeling the pallets and creating a bill of materials for them to keep my work uniform and record the endevour.  The origional OpenSCAD files I used to create the first one was specific to that pallet, but as more pallets of different sizes have become nessisary I have determined that it is in my best interst to automate the design process using the same variables I manualy calculate the possitions of each component with.
